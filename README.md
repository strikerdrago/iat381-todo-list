### Assignment 2 / Final Project for Mobile Design and Development at Simon Fraser University

[Try it](http://strikerdrago.github.io/iat381-todo-list/todo-list-angular/dist/#/) on your fast phone or tablet at GitHub Pages.

#### Summary
This is a to-do list app that makes use of specific touch gestures to create, resize, delete, edit, and move various to-dos, represented by bouncy bubbles. The to-dos have different sizes, colours, and positions to represent their priority or whatever the user wants, and they react to other bubbles created in the app.

The folder "todo-list" is our Assignment 2 submission, running inside [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/). The folder "todo-list-angular" is our final version (we attempted and failed to use [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) views).
